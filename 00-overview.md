# What is CAIPE (Community AI Platform Engineering)

## Description

<img src="images/caipe.svg" width="200" height="200" alt="CAIPE Logo">

**Community AI Platform Engineering (CAIPE)** (pronounced as `cape`) is an open-source, Multi-Agentic AI System (MAS) championed by the [CNOE (Cloud Native Operational Excellence)](https://cnoe.io) forum. CAIPE provides a secure, scalable, persona-driven reference implementation with built-in knowledge base retrieval that streamlines platform operations, accelerates workflows, and fosters innovation for modern engineering teams. It integrates seamlessly with Internal Developer Portals like Backstage and developer environments such as VS Code, enabling frictionless adoption and extensibility.

CAIPE is empowered by a set of specialized sub-agents that integrate seamlessly with essential engineering tools. Below are some common platform agents leveraged by the MAS agent:

* ☁️ AWS Agent for cloud ops
* 🚀 ArgoCD Agent for continuous deployment
* 🚨 PagerDuty Agent for incident management
* 🐙 GitHub Agent for version control
* 🗂️ Jira/Confluence Agent for project management
* ☸ Kubernetes Agent for K8s ops
* 💬 Slack/Webex Agents for team communication
* 📊 Splunk Agent for observability

...and many more platform agents are available for additional tools and use cases.

**_Tip:💡 CAIPE (Community AI Platform Engineering), pronounced like cape (as in a superhero cape 🦸‍♂️🦸‍♀️). Just as a 🦸‍♂️ cape empowers a superhero, CAIPE empowers platform engineers with 🤖 Agentic AI automation! 🚀_**
