# Mission Check 4 - Reconnaissance & Reporting back (RAG + Git agent)

<br>

## Overview
<br>
In this mission, you'll deploy and interact with specialized agents for **knowledge retrieval** and **version control**:

- **üìö RAG Agent**: Use Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to answer questions about Mars
- **üîß Git Agent**: Automate git operations like commits, pushes, and repository management

This demonstrates how agents can access external knowledge bases and automate development workflows.

## Step 1: Launch RAG + Git Agent Stack
<br>
Make sure you are in the ai-platform-engineering directory:

```bash
cd $HOME/work/ai-platform-engineering
```

Copy over the mission4 environment variables file:

```bash
cp .env.mission4 .env
```

Start the Docker Compose stack that includes both RAG and Git agents:

```bash
docker compose -f workshop/docker-compose.mission4.yaml up
```

**üëÄ Observe:** You should see the following in the logs:

```console
...
===================================
       GITHUB AGENT CONFIG      
===================================
AGENT_URL: http://agent-github-p2p:8000‚Å†
===================================
===================================
       KB-RAG AGENT CONFIG      
===================================
AGENT_URL: http://kb-rag:8000‚Å†
===================================
2025-08-21 14:10:48,082 - INFO - ‚úÖ Added github to registry (reachable)
2025-08-21 14:10:48,082 - INFO - ‚úÖ Added kb-rag to registry (reachable)
...
```

The docker-compose stack should start the following services:

- `platform-engineer-p2p` : The platform engineer supervisor agent
- `agent-github-p2p` : The git agent
- `kb-rag-agent` : The RAG agent
- `kb-rag-server` : The RAG server
- `kb-rag-web`: The RAG web interface
- `milvus-standalone`: The Milvus vector database
- `etcd`: Needed for Milvus
- `minio`: Needed for Milvus


**ü´∏ Wait:** Wait until this process is completed.

You can verify the supervisor agent is healthy by checking the health endpoint.

**‚ûï Open another terminal** (top-right '+' icon), and run the following command:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/.well-known/agent.json | jq
```

<br>
<hr>

## Step 2: Populate RAG database
<br>
Now, we will populate the RAG with documentation. The docker-compose stack should have started the `kb-rag-web` service, which is the web ui
for the RAG server. 

<a href="/" onclick="javascript:event.target.port=6100" target="_blank">Open the RAG Web UI by clicking here (Opens in new tab)</a>

Once the RAG Web UI is open:

1. Copy the URL for Mars wiki page (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars) and paste it in `Ingest URL` field
2. Click `Ingest` button
3. **ü´∏ Wait:** Wait for the ingestion to complete


**üëÄ Observe:** The status should show as `‚úÖ Successfully processed 1 URL(s)`

### Explanation:

Here's what happens:

 - The RAG server crawls webpage (it also supports sitemap), and fetches the page.
 - The HTML is parsed and content is extracted.
 - If the page is too large, it is split into chunks, using [Recursive Text Splitter](https://python.langchain.com/docs/how_to/recursive_text_splitter/).
 - Each chunk is sent to embedding model (LLM in this case) to generate embeddings.
 - The embeddings are stored in a vector store (Milvus), along with metadata (source, title, description etc).

## Step 3: Verify RAG System is working
<br>
We will now use the UI to query the RAG system and verify it is working.

<a href="/" onclick="javascript:event.target.port=6100" target="_blank">Open RAG Web UI again</a>

**Type:** `Axial tilt` in the query box, then **Click:** `Search` button

**üëÄ Observe:** The response should return relevant document chunks. The chunks may not be formatted in a way that is easy to read. As long as some document chunks are returned, the RAG system is working.


<br>
<hr>

## Step 4: Using the RAG Agent
<br>

```bash
docker run -it --network=host ghcr.io/cnoe-io/agent-chat-cli:stable
```

Note: When prompted for token, press enter.

This should open a CLI chat client. You can now interact with the supervisor agent.

**Ask the agent:**

```bash
What is the axial tilt of Mars?
```

**üëÄ Observe:** The agent should respond with the axial tilt of Mars, and cite the source of the information.

### Explanation:

Here's what happens:

 - The RAG agent embeds the question using the same embedding model used to embed the documents.
 - The agent then uses the vector store to find the most similar documents.
 - The agent uses the retrieved document chunks to answer the question.

## Step 5: Multi-agent interaction
<br>

Now, we will test the multi-agent interaction by asking the supervisor agent to: 
 - search for information about Mars (reconnaissance) 
 - commit the steps to git repository (report back).


In the CLI chat client, ask the agent:

```bash
Research and write a report on mars surface, then commit it as a text file named '%%LABNAME%%-report.txt' to my github repository https://github.com/outshiftcaipe/mission-mars-colony
```

**üëÄ Observe:** The agent should create a report (named `%%LABNAME%%-report.txt`), and commit it to the [workshop git repository](https://github.com/outshiftcaipe/mission-mars-colony).

### Explanation:

Here's what happens:

 - The supervisor agent determines what needs to be done, and delegates the tasks to the sub agents.
 - It first asks the RAG agent to search for information about Mars surface. 
 - The RAG agent uses the vector store to find relavant information, and write a report.
 - The supervisor agent then asks the git agent to commit the report as a text file to the repository.

### Graph RAG

The AI platform engineering repository also includes **Graph RAG**, which uses Neo4J to create knowledge graphs from structured data (K8s objects, AWS resources). 
See the [Graph RAG documentation](https://cnoe-io.github.io/ai-platform-engineering/knowledge_bases/graph_rag) for more details, and how to run it in your local environment.

### RAG Agent

More information on the RAG agent can be found [here](https://github.com/cnoe-io/ai-platform-engineering/tree/main/ai_platform_engineering/knowledge_bases/rag).

### Unified Knowledge Base

Currently there is a open discussion on how to unify different RAG systems, and create a unified knowledge base thats specialized for AI platform engineering. Please follow the discussion [here](https://github.com/cnoe-io/ai-platform-engineering/discussions/196).

### Github agent

The Github agent can be used as is. Please refer to the [Github agent documentation](https://github.com/cnoe-io/ai-platform-engineering/tree/main/ai_platform_engineering/agents/github) for more details.
