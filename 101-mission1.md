## Agentic AI Concepts

Let's review some key concepts.

### What is an Agent?

An AI Agent is a system that uses a Large Language Model (LLM) to decide the flow of an application

### ReAct Loop

Reason and Act (ReAct) is a common
design pattern used in agentic systems to help LLMs decide the next action or tool to use

### What is a Multi-Agent System (MAS)?

A Multi-Agent System (MAS) is an agentic AI system composed of multiple, independent and interacting agents to achieve a common goal

Here are some example MAS architecture patterns:

### MAS Network/Swarm Architecture

MAS architecture where agents communitcate in a network like pub-sub, multi-cast or broadcast groups. Each agent is aware of and can hand-off to any other agent(s) in the group

<img src="images/mas-network.svg" alt="Mission Control" width="400">

### MAS Planner/Deep Agent Architecture

Simple ReAct agents can yield agents that are ‚Äúshallow‚Äù. They are particularly not very good at longer running tasks, more complex tasks with mutli-turn conversations.

A class MAS systems called ‚ÄúDeep Research‚Äù agents implement a planner based architecture, to plan a set of tasks and invoke the sub-agents, system tools in combination with Human-in-the-loop. Examples: Claude Code, AWS Q Cli etc.

### MAS Supervisor Architecture

A supervisor agent orchestrates tasks with a bunch of sub-agents with the same system or over network

### MAS Hierarchical Supervisor Architecture

## MCP (Model Context Protocol)

MCP (Model Context Protocol) standardizes how large language models (LLMs) can get application or API context such as tools, system prompts etc.

## Difference between an AI agent vs MCP server

Agentic Systems landscape is evolving rapidly, understanding the distinction between AI Agents and MCP Servers is crucial for building scalable agentic systems. While MCP Servers provide a standardized interface for tools and data sources, AI Agents leverage these capabilities to perform complex reasoning, planning, and execution tasks. As MCP protocol advances the lines are blurring, as of today, AI Agents are superset of what MCP server can do but some agents are directly exposed via MCP.

## A2A Protocol

The Agent2Agent (A2A) Protocol is an open standard designed to enable seamless communication and collaboration between AI agents over the network.

## AGNTCY Collective

The AGNTCY project provides the complete infrastructure stack for agent collaboration‚Äîdiscovery, identity, messaging, and observability that works across any vendor or framework. It is the foundational layer that lets specialized agents find each other, verify capabilities, and work together on complex problems.
