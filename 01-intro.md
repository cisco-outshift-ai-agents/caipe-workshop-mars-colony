<img src="images/mission-control.svg" alt="Mission Control" width="450">

You and your team have landed on **Mars** to establish **Mission Control operations with Agentic AI**.

Your **mission** is to set up communication and weather monitoring systems so life in the new habitat runs smoothly, while staying connected to Earth by reporting your findings.

Along the way, you’ll complete a **series of Mission Checks**, each building on the last — starting with a single agent, then expanding to a distributed multi-agent system using A2A and MCP, and finally running CAIPE (Community AI Platform Engineering) MAS and interfact using Backstage/CLI interface.


## 🧭 Mission Checks

### **Mission Check 1 — Download Mission and Learn the Controls**
Clone the repo, set up prerequisites, and bring Mission Control online.

### **Mission Check 2 — Create Life**
Run the **Petstore Agent** and confirm your first AI agent is alive.

### **Mission Check 3 — Scan the Skies**
Introduce the **Multi-Agent Mars Weather** system to monitor dust storms.

### **Mission Check 4 — Mission Control Manual (KB RAG)**
Launch the **Knowledge Base RAG system**, ingest docs, and query them.

### **Mission Check 5 — Report Findings to Earth**
Use the **GitHub + Work Tracking Agent** to write a combined report from Petstore, Weather, and RAG.

### **Mission Check 6 — Assemble with idpbuilder**
Package the full CAIPE stack into reproducible deployable bundles.

### **Mission Check 7 — Tracing and Evaluation**
Customize prompts, enable tracing, and evaluate agent workflows.

### **Mission Check 8 — Run CAIPE with AGNTCY SLIM**
Deploy with AGNTCY integrations for production-like workflows.
