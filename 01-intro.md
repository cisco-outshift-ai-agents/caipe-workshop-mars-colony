<img src="images/mission-control.svg" alt="Mission Control" width="450">

You and your team have landed on **Mars** 🟠 to establish **Mission Control operations with Agentic AI**. 📡🤖🚀

🎯 Your **mission** is to set up 🛰️ communication and 🌦️ weather monitoring systems so life in the new habitat runs smoothly, while staying connected to Earth 🌍 by reporting your findings. 📡

Along the way, you’ll complete a **series of Mission Checks**, each building on the last — starting with a single agent 🤖, then expanding to a distributed multi-agent system using A2A and MCP 🌐, and finally running CAIPE (Community AI Platform Engineering) MAS and interfacing using Backstage/CLI interface. 🖥️🛸
