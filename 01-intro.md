<img src="images/mission-control.svg" alt="Mission Control" width="450">

You and your team have landed on **Mars** 🟠 to establish **Mission Control operations with Agentic AI**. 📡🤖🚀

🎯 Your **mission** is to set up 🛰️ communication and 🌦️ weather monitoring systems so life in the new habitat runs smoothly, while staying connected to Earth 🌍 by reporting your findings. 📡

Along the way, you’ll complete a **series of Mission Checks:**

- Starting with a single agent 🤖 using MCP and A2A and verify communication over A2A using [agent-chat-cli](https://github.com/cnoe-io/agent-chat-cli)
- Expanding to a distributed multi-agent system using A2A and MCP 🌐 with multiple example agents to build the usecase
- And finally running CAIPE (Community AI Platform Engineering) MAS and interacting with it using rich Backstage Web UI or agent-chat-cli interface. 🖥️🛸

## Workshop Logistics and Support

- **🔍 Demo Lab Navigation**
  - Easily switch between the **Lab Guide**, **Terminal**, and **IDE** using the toggles in the **top right corner** of your screen.
  - Familiarize yourself with the interface before starting your missions for a smoother experience.

- **💻 Workspace Directory**
  - Your main workspace is located at: `/home/ubuntu/work`
  - Use the **IDE** toggle (top right) to access your files and code editor.
  - For terminal navigation, try using [`mc` - Midnight Commander](https://linuxcommand.org/lc3_adv_mc.php) (a visual file manager). Launch it in the terminal for a split-pane view.

- **🆘 Need Help?**
  - Raise your hand and chat with a workshop team member during the session so a team member can start a breakout session.
  - Click the **Mission Help** button (the last button on the mission navigation guide) at any time for mission assistance, troubleshooting tips, or to revisit these instructions.
  - For additional help, check out the [CAIPE FAQs](https://cisco.sharepoint.com/sites/CAIPE/SitePages/CAIPE-FAQs.aspx) for answers to common workshop and platform questions.

- **🤝 Breakout Sessions**
  - Each mission begins with a **3–5 minute explanation** from the instructor, followed by group breakout sessions for hands-on practice.
  - Breakout sessions are time-constrained, but if you need more time to complete a mission, just let your instructor know!
  - At the end of each breakout session, you will rejoin the main group for the next mission. Adjustments will be made to ensure everyone can keep up with the missions.

- **⏳ Lab Availability**
  - Your lab environment will remain active for **48 hours** after the workshop, until **EOD Friday (Pacific Time)**.
  - Please save your work and download any important files before your instance is terminated (as hosting VMs incurs costs).
