# Your Mission - Mission Control for Mars Colony

<img src="images/mission-control.svg" alt="Mission Control" width="256">

You and your team have arrived on Mars to establish mission control operations with Agentic AI. Your goal is to set up communication and weather monitoring systems to ensure life in the new habitat runs smoothly and can communicate back to Earth in a series of mission checks.

## Description

This hands-on workshop takes you from cloning the CAIPE (Community AI Platform Engineering) repo all the way to running CAIPE on your local machine or VM.

Using the Mars Colony theme, each Mission Check builds on the last — starting small (running a single agent) and ending with production-grade deployment, observability, and incident automation.

You will:

- Learn about CAIPE

- Basic LLM + Tools, MCP, A2A, Agent Chat CLI

- Run and extend agents locally.

- Orchestrate multi-agent workflows.

- Commit code and open tickets with GitHub/Jira agents.

- Add monitoring and automated alerting.

- Bundle and deploy with idpbuilder.

- Secure access and scale on Kubernetes (EKS).
